/**
 * JiBX bindings for the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF).
 *
 * <p>
 * This package includes a single JiBX binding having the name {@code pidf}.
 * The binding technically does not adhere to RFC 3863 because it doesn't allow arbitrary nested
 * elements from other namespaces in several locations where supporting that is required. This is
 * because JiBX doesn't support doing that.
 * <p>
 *
 * @see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3863">RFC 3863</a>
